    <h1 class="underline">Roux Academy 2012 Contemporary Art Conference (CAC)</h1>
    <h2>Venue</h2>
    <div class="box">
    <p>Hotel Contempo is the perfect spot for a gathering of modern artists. We <span class="underline">strongly recommend</span> you stay here for optimal
    participation in the conference.</p>
    
    <p>However, for those who opt to stay at another location, there is certainly no shortage of hotels in Downtown Seattle. As
    a local tour guide mentioned, <q>Seattle features hotels ranging from shabby chic to the ultimate in sophistication - there
    is a something to suit everyoneâ€™s taste.</q></p>

    <p>These hotels include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Golden Dragon Inn</li>
        <li>Phillips of Belltown</li>
        <li>The Otter Renaissance Hotel</li>
        <li>The Rage Hotel</li>
        <li>Gwendoline's Fancy</li>
